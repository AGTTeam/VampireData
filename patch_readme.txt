                   *****************************************

Before you can play the translation, you'll need to patch the game on your computer using a legal copy of the ROM. There are two methods by which this can be done, online, via the ROMhacking.net downloads page, and locally by downloading an additional piece of software. 

                         ============================
                                ONLINE METHOD        
                         ============================

-On the website which you downloaded this patch from, navigate to “Patch Online NOW!” under the ‘Links’ header.
-Upload your ROM using the ‘Choose File’ button where prompted.
-Select the patch that you wish to apply using the dropdown menu. (See ‘Rom Dump Compatibility’ for further explanation)
-Click ‘Apply Patch’, and wait for the download to complete. You should now have a patched copy of the ROM, labelled -input source- (patched).

                         ===========================
                               SOFTWARE METHOD      
                         ===========================

-Download DeltaPatcher from https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/
-Extract the file, and run either DeltaPatcher or DeltaPatcherLite
-'Original file' should be your copy of the ROM, as an '.nds' filetype.
-For 'XDelta patch', choose the 'VampirePatch.xdelta' file.
-Hit apply patch, and you're good to go!
*Note that this will overwrite your original file. If you’d like to keep a copy of it instead, change the settings by clicking the cog icon, and tick “Backup original file”. This will create a new ‘--PATCHED.nds’ file instead.

Play this file on an emulator such as DeSmuME, or use a flashcart to play it on any member of the NDS family.


***NOTE: ROM DUMP COMPATIBILITY***
This patch is designed to work with a 100% correctly dumped ROM (CRC: ED8A5F4A).

If your ROM is a bad dump (CRC: 1CB4B97C), you can apply the "bad_to_good.xdelta" patch BEFORE applying the translation patch by following the guide above.

PLAYER NAME
In the original game, players were able to enter a custom name (default 黒主 優姫 Cross Yuki), which would then be used throughout the game whenever a character addressed the protagonist. This name had a limit of 3x3 characters, which we were unable to extend. After much consideration, we decided to remove the custom name feature, and hardcode all entries as ‘Yuki Cross’.

The name entry screen is still visible in the patch, where it now serves the purpose of save game identification only. We also decided to invert the default name to 優姫 黒主 (Yuki Cross), in English name order.

SPACE LIMITATIONS
Due to technical limitations, we had to limit the character count in the minigame menu descriptions and the item shop. This undoubtedly led to some awkward translations and a loss of the original flavor, but we don’t believe these should affect the overall enjoyment of the game.

Fortunately, these are the only two areas which are affected, and we were able to add custom dictionary compression to the rest of the game, greatly increasing the amount of space available for the rest of the translations.
